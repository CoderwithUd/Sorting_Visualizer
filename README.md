# Sorting Visualizer Project

This project is a sorting visualizer aimed at demonstrating both algorithmic skills in data structures and algorithms (DSA) and proficiency in web development. It serves as a major project for college, showcasing the developer's understanding of various sorting algorithms and their implementation, as well as their ability to create a user-friendly web interface.

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer project is designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work by animating the process of sorting a list of elements. It offers a hands-on experience for users to observe and understand the behavior of various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** The project provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the sorting algorithms effortlessly.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** It supports a variety of sorting algorithms, enabling users to choose and visualize the sorting process for different algorithms.
- **Real-time Visualization:** The sorting process is visualized in real-time, allowing users to observe how the elements get rearranged step by step.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can customize parameters such as array size, animation speed, and type of sorting algorithm to tailor the visualization according to their preferences.
- **Educational Purpose:** The project serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts to learn about sorting algorithms in a practical and engaging manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including libraries like React.js or D3.js for visualization)
- **Backend:** (If applicable, mention the backend technologies used)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub (or any other version control system)

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sorting-visualizer
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Choose the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the options provided.
2. Adjust the array size and animation speed according to your preferences.
3. Click on the "Sort" button to start the visualization process.
4. Observe the step-by-step sorting animation and the final sorted array.
5. Experiment with different sorting algorithms and parameters to gain a better understanding of how they work.
